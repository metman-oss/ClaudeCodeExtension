 *
 * Purpose: "On Agent Finish" feature — detects when the embedded agent stops working by
 *          watching the conhost screen buffer for quiescence (the visible text + cursor
 *          position stop changing), then optionally plays a sound, shows a Visual Studio
 *          info bar (duration, and token count when the provider is Claude), and runs an
 *          action (build / run / tests / a script / a command sent back to the agent).
 *
 *          Console-output quiescence is provider-agnostic: it works for any agent running
 *          in the Command Prompt (conhost) terminal. TUIs that animate a spinner / elapsed
 *          timer while busy read as "changing" and a settled input prompt reads as "idle".
 *
 *          Windows Terminal support: the embedded WT window belongs to WindowsTerminal.exe, not
 *          the cmd.exe running inside its ConPTY, so the classic window-based client resolution
 *          can't find the console to read. The ConPTY client (cmd.exe) is resolved at launch
 *          (ResolveWtConsoleClientPid) and the watcher AttachConsole's to it directly, reading the
 *          real screen buffer through the exact same path as Command Prompt — so alternate-screen
 *          TUIs (e.g. Devin) are detected and the read is cursor-blink independent. If that client
 *          can't be resolved/read, the watcher falls back to reading the visible text via UI
 *          Automation (WT implements the UIA Text pattern for accessibility).
